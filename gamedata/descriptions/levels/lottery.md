This scam lottery allows participants to place bets and guess the right number to win the funds in the contract. When the owner decides the time is right, they choose the winning number. Your crypto-anarchism kicks in and you decide to show the owner what's up. 

You'll win this level by creating a denial-of-service (DOS) condition preventing the owner from releasing the funds.
