This scam lottery requires players to guess the winning number to hit the jackpot. When the owner decides the time is right, they choose the winning number. Your crypto-anarchism kicks in and you decide to show the owner what's up. 

You'll win this level by creating a denial-of-service (DOS) condition preventing the owner from releasing the funds.
